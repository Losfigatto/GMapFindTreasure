Project Getting and Cleaning Data
================
##Human Activity Recognition
###  DESCRIPTION HOW I WORKED FOR CLEAN DATA 
In script file, I commented the single step.
I loaded the file the corresponding to testing and training data in different data table, then I merged in "DS" data set
with this columns :

	subj ( identify loaded from "subject_(train|test).txt" file)
	activityIndex (numeric code to identify the activity loaded from "y_(train|test).txt" file )
	[...] (loaded each value contained into X_(train|test).txt file which to marking single column 
	       with the name contained into Y_(train|test).txt file after cleaned from illegal characters)
